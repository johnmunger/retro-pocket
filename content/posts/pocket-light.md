Toyota GameBoy Pocket

<!--more-->

![Toyota GameBoy Pocket]|(/img/toyota2.jpeg)

This product is a modified Game Boy Pocket. Modifications include a backlight kit and bivert chip. “Type-c” models add a rechargeable lithium polymer battery pack and USB charging port.  

These modifications are installed by an experienced technician. In addition, each Game Boy is stripped down to it’s component parts, cleaned and tested. If we find a faulty or heavily worn component we replace it. The end product has an authentic look and feel with all the attention to detail you would expect had Nintendo offered a backlit Game Boy all the way back in 1996.

* Restoration may include new components like battery terminals, speakers, capacitors, labels, etc..
